# Final Project Structure

This project follows Git Flow branching model:

## Branches
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **dev**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: Feature development branches

## Project Sections
Each section will be developed in its own feature branch:

1. Section 1: Project Setup and Configuration
2. Section 2: Core Functionality
3. Section 3: User Interface
4. Section 4: Testing and Documentation
5. Section 5: Deployment and CI/CD

## Git Flow Process
1. All features branch from `dev`
2. Features are merged back to `dev`
3. When ready for release, `dev` is merged to `main` via PR
